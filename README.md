# PCA-classification
Given an image from Sentinel-2 containing 66 bands I performed PCA (Principal Component Analysis) in Python. Additionally I calculated correlation and covariance matrixes for first 3 bands. Next I worked in GoogleEarthEngine where on prepared before testing and training data by our professor I made classification (Random Forest) and calculated overall accuracy for both original image and image made from PCA components.
